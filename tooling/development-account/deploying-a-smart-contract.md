# Deploying a smart contract

If you wish to deploy your smart contract using [Hardhat](../../tutorials/hardhat-tutorials/), [Truffle](../../tutorials/truffle-tutorials/) or [Waffle](../../tutorials/waffle-tutorials/) development frameworks, please refer to their respective section of the documentation.

Additionally you can deploy your smart contract using the EVM playground. The documentation about doing so is available in the [EVM playground](../evm-playground/) section.
