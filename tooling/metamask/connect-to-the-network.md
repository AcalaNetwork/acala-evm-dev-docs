NOTE: The manual process example connects to the Mandala EVM+. For other networks can substitute the values with any of the values provided at the [network configuration](../../network/network-configuration.md) section.

In order to be able to interact with the Acala EVM+ in Mandala TC9, you first need to navigate to the **Add network** section of the MetaMask. You can find it at the bottom of the list of available networks after clicking on the currently active network.

This should open up a form to add a new network to your MetaMask (you might have to unlock MetaMask before it opens). Once the form is opened, use the following information to add the Mandala TC9 network.
